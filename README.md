# Awesome (Linux amd64) CLI Binaries

> This image builds a static version of tmux and downloads latest Linux amd64
> binaries of popular terminal utilities. Quickly install the newest utilities
> on any Linux server.

## Use-case

Working on many remote servers? Can't install your favorite tools for some
reason? With this repo, you can quickly upload them to a remote Linux server,
together with comfortable pre-made configurations.

## Setup

1. Install [just] on your workstation. (macOS: `brew install just`)

1. Prepare the binaries on your workstation:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com/rafi/awesome-cli-binaries.git
    cd awesome-cli-binaries
    ```

1. **Optional:** To speed up things, you can pull the image from Docker Hub:

    ```sh
    docker pull rafib/awesome-cli-binaries
    ```

1. Run `just docker` â€” this can take time! It builds tmux from source and
   downloads all binaries. (Make sure you have `GITHUB_TOKEN` or
   `HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable, set with your token, to
   avoid GitHub's rate-limiting.)

1. Finally, run `just binaries` to copy all binaries from image into `bin/`.

## Provision Remote Node

Use the `setup.sh` helper script to provision servers.

```sh
./setup.sh -h
./setup.sh me@myserver.com [more...]
```

## Sync Binaries

If you just want to update the binaries on remote, run:

```sh
just me@myserver.com [more...]
```

This will rsync local binaries at `./bin` to remote `~/.local/bin`.

## Binaries

- [tmux] v3.4 statically linked (+ncurses +libevent)
- [neovim] build with support for glibc 2.17
