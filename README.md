## Accompanying Provisioning Script

Use-case: üí° Working on many remote servers? Can't install your favorite tools
for some reason? With this repo, you can quickly upload them to a remote Linux
server, together with comfortable pre-made configurations.

> [!WARNING]
> [`.files/*`](./.files/) will be copied to the remote server you provision with
> this script, so make sure to backup the remote `~/.config` directory first, if
> there's anything valuable there.

### Option ‚ü™1‚ü´ üëæ Provision from Remote

Login and run on **remote server**: (‚ö†Ô∏è READ WARNING ABOVE BEFORE!)

```sh
ssh my-remote-server
curl -sfL init.rafi.io | sh
```

### Option ‚ü™2‚ü´ üíª Provision from Workstation

Prerequisites: Install [just] on your workstation. (macOS: `brew install just`)

```sh
git clone git@github.com/rafi/awesome-cli-binaries.git
cd awesome-cli-binaries

just binaries amd64  # or arm64
./sync.sh me@myserver.com [more...]
```

`just binaries` copies all binaries to local `./bin/` directory, and the
[`sync.sh`](./sync.sh) script provisions the remote server.

### Option ‚ü™3‚ü´ üß∞ Copy Only Binaries

If you just want to copy or update the binaries on remote, run:

```sh
just sync me@myserver.com [more...]
```

This will rsync local binaries at `./bin` to remote `~/.local/bin`.

## Binaries

- [tmux] v3.5a statically linked (+ncurses +libevent)
- [fish] v4 (rust rewrite)
- [neovim] build with support for glibc 2.17
