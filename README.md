> Quickly install the newest utilities on any Linux server, sudo-less! :rocket: :moon:
>
> This repository contains a collection of popular CLI utilities:
>
> - [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) - Builds all binaries statically linked for Linux
>   amd64, including latest tmux and fish.
> - [.files](./.files/) - Dotfiles to copy to remote servers.
> - [setup.sh](./setup.sh) - Script to provision remote servers.

## Use-case

Working on many remote servers? Can't install your favorite tools for some
reason? With this repo, you can quickly upload them to a remote Linux server,
together with comfortable pre-made configurations.

## Setup

> [!WARNING]
> [`.files/*`](./.files/) will be copied to the remote server you provision with
> this script, so make sure to backup the remote `~/.config` directory first.

### Option 1: Provision on Remote

‚ùó Login to the **remote server** and run:

```sh
ssh my-remote-server
curl -fL init.rafi.io | bash
```

### Option 2: Provision From Workstation

Prerequisites: Install [just] on your workstation. (macOS: `brew install just`)

```sh
git clone git@github.com/rafi/awesome-cli-binaries.git
cd awesome-cli-binaries

just binaries
./setup.sh me@myserver.com [more...]
```

`just binaries` copies all binaries to local `./bin/` directory, and the
[`setup.sh`](./setup.sh) script provisions the remote server.

## Sync Binaries

If you just want to copy or update the binaries on remote, run:

```sh
just sync me@myserver.com [more...]
```

This will rsync local binaries at `./bin` to remote `~/.local/bin`.

## Binaries

- [tmux] v3.5a statically linked (+ncurses +libevent)
- [fish] v4
- [neovim] build with support for glibc 2.17
